@article{Neuhauser2005a,
abstract = {Let H and be two discrete groups and X be a set on which acts. We investigate when the wreath product H X has relative property (T) and give a complete characterization of property (T) for such groups. Moreover we determine a lower bound of a Kazhdan constant for H X in terms of those for H and . Property ($\tau$) of H X is also discussed in some instances.},

@article{Cherix2004,
abstract = {We introduce the notion of a space with measured walls, generalizing the concept of a space with walls due to Haglund and Paulin (Simplicit{\'{e}} de groupes d'automorphismes d'espaces {\`{a}} courbure n{\'{e}}gative. Geom. Topol. Monograph 1 (1998), 181-248). We observe that if a locally compact group G acts properly on a space with measured walls, then G has the Haagerup property. We conjecture that the converse holds and we prove this conjecture for the following classes of groups: discrete groups with the Haagerup property, closed subgroups of SO(n, 1), groups acting properly on real trees, SL 2 (K) where K is a global field and amenable groups.},
