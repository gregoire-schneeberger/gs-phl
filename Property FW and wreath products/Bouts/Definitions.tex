\subsection{Ends of Schreier graphs and property FW}
\label{Subsection:FW}
%
%
%
%
%
In what follows, we will always assume that generating sets of groups are \emph{symmetric}, that is we will look at $S\subset G$ such that $s\in S$ if and only if $s^{-1}\in S$.
Our graphs will be undirected and we will sometimes identify  graph with its vertex set.
%
%
\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ and $S$ a symmetric generating set. The \emph{(left) Schreier graph} $\Sch(G,H;S)$ is the graph with vertices the left cosets $gH=\setst{gh}{h\in H}$ and with an edge between $gH$ and $sgH$ for every $s$ in $S$.
\end{defn}
%
%
Observe that with the above definition, a Schreier graph may have loops as well as multiple edges. Moreover, in $\Sch(G,H;S)$ every vertex has degree $\abs S$.

If $X$ is a set with a left action $G\curvearrowright X$ and $S$ is a symmetric generating set for $G$, the corresponding (left) \emph{orbital graph} $\Sch_{\mathcal O}(G,X;S)$ is the graph with vertex set $X$ and with an edge between $x$ and $y$ for every $s$ in $S$ such that $s.x=y$.
As the notation suggest, these two definitions are the two faces of the same coin. Indeed, we have $\Sch(G,H;S)=\Sch_{\mathcal O}(G,G/H;S)$ for the  action by left multiplication of $G$ on $G/H$, while   for every $x\in X$, the graph $\Sch(G,\stab_G(x);S)$ is equal to the connected component of $x$ in $\Sch_{\mathcal O}(G,X;S)$.

Schreier graphs are generalizations of the well-known \emph{Cayley graphs}, with $\Cayley(G;S)=\Sch(G,\{1\};S)$.

If $S$ and $T$ are two generating sets of $G$, the graphs $\Sch(G,H;S)$ and $\Sch(G,H;T)$ need not to be isomorphic. However, if both $S$ and $T$ are finite, then $\Sch(G,H;S)$ and $\Sch(G,H;T)$ are quasi-isometric, see \cite[IV.B.21.iii]{DelaHarpe2000} for a proof and Figure~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ} for an example. The only fact we will use about quasi-isometries is that they preserve ``large-scale properties'' of the graph, as for examples the number of ends.
Observe that the requirement that both $S$ and $T$ are finite is crucial for the existence of a quasi-isometry between the corresponding Schreier graphs. Indeed, for every group  $\Cayley(G;G\setminus\{1\})=\Sch(G,\{1\};G\setminus\{1\})$ is always a complete graph on $\abs{G}$ vertices, in particular  $\Cayley(\Z;\{1\})$ and $\Cayley(\Z;\Z\setminus\{0\})$ are not quasi-isometric.

Let $\Gamma$ be a graph and $K$ a finite subset of vertices. The graph $\Gamma\setminus K$ is the subgraph of $\Gamma$ obtained by deleting all vertices in $K$ and all edges adjacent to them. This graph is not necessarily connected.
\begin{defn}\label{Def:Ends}
Let $\Gamma$ be a graph. The \emph{number of ends} of $\Gamma$ is the supremum, taken over all finite $K$, of the number of infinite connected components of $\Gamma\setminus K$.
\end{defn}
There exists other characterization of the number of ends in graphs, %notably in terms of equivalence classes of rays,
see \cite{MR1967888} and the references therein, but Definition \ref{Def:Ends} is the one that best suits our purpose.
%The interested reader may refer to \cite{MR1967888} and the references therein for an extended treatment of the 
A locally finite graph (i.e. such that every vertex has finite degree) is finite if and only if it has $0$ ends.
%The graphs of the Figures~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ} and \ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ2} have respectively 2 ends and 1 end. 

An important fact about the number of ends of a graph, is that it is an invariant of quasi-isometry, see \cite{MR1213151}. In particular, if $G$ is a finitely generated group it is possible to speak about the number of ends of the Schreier graph $\Sch(G,H;S)$ without specifying a particular finite generating set $S$.
By a celebrated result of Stallings \cite{Stallings1971}, the number of ends of a Cayley graph of a finitely generated group can only be $0$, $1$, $2$ or infinite (in which case it is uncountable), see Figures~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ} and \ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ2} for examples.
On the other hand, Schreier graphs may have any number of ends in $\mathbf N\cup\{\infty\}$, see Figure~\ref{Figure:SchreierOfF2} for an example of a graph with $4$ ends.
%While the number of ends of Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups can only be $0$, $1$, $2$ or infinite (in which case it is uncountable) \cite[Theorem 11.27]{Stallings1971}, Schreier graphs may have any number of ends in $\mathbf N\cup\{\infty\}$, see Figure~\ref{Figure:SchreierOfF2} for an example of a graph with another number of ends.
In fact, every regular graph of even degree is isomorphic to a Schreier graph, \cite{MR0450121,MR1358635}. 

We are now finally able to introduce property FW. The following characterization is due to Cornulier \cite{Cornulier2013}.
%
%
\begin{defn}
A finitely generated group $G$ has \emph{property FW} if all its Schreier graphs have at most one end.
\end{defn}
%
%
It directly follows from the definition that all finite groups have property FW, but that $\Z$ does not have it.
In fact, if $G$ is a finitely generated group with an homomorphism onto $\Z$, then it does not have FW. Indeed, in this case $G\cong H\rtimes \Z$  for some $H$ and the Schreier graph $\Sch(G,H;S)$ will be isomorphic to a Cayley graph of $\Z\cong G/H$ and hence has $2$ ends.

Property FW admits many distinct characterizations that allow to define it for groups that are non-necessarily finitely generated and even for topological groups. We refer the reader to \cite{Cornulier2013} for a survey of these characterizations.

\subsection{Wreath products}
%
%
%
%
%
Let $X$ be a set and $G$ a group. We view 
$\bigoplus_XG$ as the set of functions from $X$ to $G$ with finite support:
\[
	\bigoplus_XG=\setst{\varphi\colon X\to G}{\varphi(x)=1 \textnormal{ for all but finitely many }x}.
\]
This is naturally a group, where multiplication is taken componentwise.

If $H$ is a group acting on $X$, then it naturally acts on $\bigoplus_XG$
by $(h.\varphi)(x)=\varphi(h^{-1}.x)$.
This leads to the following definition
\begin{defn}\label{Def:WreathProd}
Let $G$ and $H$ be groups and $X$ be a set on which $H$ acts.
The \emph{(retricted) wreath product} $G\wr_XH$ is the group $(\bigoplus_XG)\rtimes H$.
\end{defn}
A prominent  source of examples of wreath products are the ones of the form $G\wr_HH$, where $H$ acts on itself by left multiplication.
In particular, the group $(\Z/2\Z)\wr_\Z\Z$ has become well-known under the name of the \emph{lamplighter group}.
Another (trivial) examples of wreath products are direct products $G\times H$ which corresponds to wreath products over a singleton $G\wr_{\{*\}}H$.

Let $S$ be a generating set of $G$ and $T$ a generating set of $H$.
Suppose that $H$ acts transitively on $X$ and let $x\in X$ be any point.
Finally, let $\delta_x^s$ be the element of $\bigoplus_XG$ defined by $\delta_x^s(x)=s$ and $\delta_x^s(y)=1_G$ if $y\neq x$ and let $\mathbf 1$ be the constant function with value $1$.
It is then standard that 
\[
	\setst{(\delta_x^s,1_H)}{s \in S} \cup \setst{(\mathbf 1,t}{t \in T}
\]
is a generating set for $G\wr_XH$.

On the other hand, it follows from the definition of the wreath product that we have
\[
	G\wr_XH\cong\bigoplus_{Y\textnormal{ is an $H$-orbit}}\bigl(G\wr_YH\bigr).
\]
We hence obtain
%
%
\begin{lem}
The group $G\wr_XH$ is finitely generated if and only if both $G$ and $H$ are finitely generated and $H$ acts on $X$ with finitely many orbits.
\end{lem}
%
%
Using the above lemma, we could reformulate Theorem~\ref{Thm:Main} in the following way:
%
%
\begin{prop}
Let $G$, $H$ be two groups with $G$ non-trivial and $X$ a set on which $H$ acts. Suppose that all three of $G$, $H$ and $G\wr_XH$ are finitely generated. Then the wreath product $G\wr_XH$ has property FW if and only if $G$ and $H$ have property FW and $X$ is finite.
\end{prop}
