	Abstract = {We characterize permutational wreath products with Property (FA). For instance, we show that the standard wreath product A B of two non-trivial countable groups A and B has Property (FA) if and only if B has Property (FA) and A is a finitely generated group with finite abelianization. We also prove an analogous result for hereditary Property (FA). On the other hand, we prove that many wreath products with hereditary Property (FA) are not quotients of finitely presented groups with the same property. {\textcopyright} de Gruyter 2011.},

@article{Bandelt1984,
	Abstract = {An induced subgraph G of a graph H is a retract of H if there is an edge‐preserving map f from H onto G such that f|G is the identity map on G. A median graph is a connected graph such that for any three vertices u,v and w, there exists a unique vertex x which lies simultaneously on some shortest (u,v)‐, (v,w)‐, and (w,u)‐paths. It is shown that a graph G is a retract of some hypercube if and only if G is a median graph. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1984 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

@article{Neuhauser2005a,
	Abstract = {Let H and be two discrete groups and X be a set on which acts. We investigate when the wreath product H X has relative property (T) and give a complete characterization of property (T) for such groups. Moreover we determine a lower bound of a Kazhdan constant for H X in terms of those for H and . Property ($\tau$) of H X is also discussed in some instances.},

@article{Cherix2004,
	Abstract = {We introduce the notion of a space with measured walls, generalizing the concept of a space with walls due to Haglund and Paulin (Simplicit{\'{e}} de groupes d'automorphismes d'espaces {\`{a}} courbure n{\'{e}}gative. Geom. Topol. Monograph 1 (1998), 181-248). We observe that if a locally compact group G acts properly on a space with measured walls, then G has the Haagerup property. We conjecture that the converse holds and we prove this conjecture for the following classes of groups: discrete groups with the Haagerup property, closed subgroups of SO(n, 1), groups acting properly on real trees, SL 2 (K) where K is a global field and amenable groups.},
