\begin{abstract}
The group property FW stands in-between the celebrated Kazdhan's property (T) and Serre's property FA. Among many characterizations, it might be defined, for finitely generated groups, as having all Schreier graphs one-ended.
Using this, we show that a finitely generated wreath product $G\wr_XH$ has property FW if and only if both $G$ and $H$ have property FW and $X$ is finite.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Property FW is a group property that is (for discrete groups) a weakening of the celebrated Kazdhan's property (T). It was introduced by Barnhill and Chatterji in \cite{Barnhill2008}. It is a fixed point property for actions on wall spaces or, equivalently, on CAT(0) cube complexes. Therefore it stands between property FH (fixed points on Hilbert spaces, equivalent to property (T) for discrete groups) and property FA (fixed points on \emph{arbres}\footnote{\emph{Arbres} is the french word for trees.}). It is known that all these properties are different, see  \cite{Cornulier2013} for examples of groups which distinguish them.

When working with group properties, it is natural to ask if they are stable under ``natural'' group operations. One such operation, of great use in geometric group theory, is the wreath product, which generalizes the direct product of two groups, see Definition~\ref{Def:WreathProd}.

In the context of properties defined by fixed points of actions, the first result concerning wreath products is due to Cherix, Martin and Valette and later refined by Neuhauser and concerns property (T).
%
%
\begin{thm}[\cite{Cherix2004,Neuhauser2005a}] \label{T:Wreath_prop_T}
Let $G,H$ be two discrete groups with $G$ non-trivial and $X$ a set on which $H$ acts. The wreath product $G \wr_X H$ has property (T) if and only if $G$ and $H$ have property (T) and $X$ is finite.
\end{thm}
%
%
The aim of this note is to give an elementary proof of analogous of Theorem~\ref{T:Wreath_prop_T} for property FW:
%
%
\begin{thm}\label{Thm:Main}
Let $G,H$ be two finitely generated groups with $G$ non-trivial and $X$ a set on which $H$ acts with finitely many orbits. The wreath product $G \wr_X H$ has property FW if and only if $G$ and $H$ have property FW and $X$ is finite.
\end{thm}
%
%
Our proof will rely on a characterization of property FW via ends of Schreier graphs, see Subsection \ref{Subsection:FW} for the relevant definitions.
Note that Cornulier also proved in \cite{Cornulier2013} that if $G\wr_XH$ has property FW (and $G$ is non trivial), then $X$ is finite.

Corulier and Kar studied the question of stability of wreath product for property FA in \cite{Cornulier2011}. They proved a similar result if the action of the group $H$ has finitely many orbits and no fixed point. The condition that $G$ has property FA is replaced by $G$ has finite abelianization and $G$ can not be expressed as a countable union of properly increasing sequence of subgroups.

At this point, the curious reader might have two questions. First, is it possible to extend Theorem \ref{Thm:Main} beyond the realms of finitely generated groups and of actions with finitely many orbits? And secondly, is there a link between Theorems \ref{T:Wreath_prop_T} and \ref{Thm:Main}?
In both cases, the answer is yes.
This is the subject of the forthcoming and more technical paper \cite{LS2021}, which gives an unified proof of Theorems \ref{T:Wreath_prop_T} and \ref{Thm:Main} as well as of similar results for the Bergman's property and more.

\subsection{Ends of Schreier graphs and property FW}
\label{Subsection:FW}
%
%
%
%
%
In what follows, we will always assume that generating sets of groups are \emph{symmetric}, that is we will look at $S\subset G$ such that $s\in S$ if and only if $s^{-1}\in S$.
Our graphs will be undirected and we will sometimes identify a graph with its vertex set.
%
%
\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ and $S$ a symmetric generating set. The \emph{(left) Schreier graph} $\Sch(G,H;S)$ is the graph with vertices the left cosets $gH=\setst{gh}{h\in H}$ and for every $\{s,s^{-1}\}\subset S$ an edge between $gH$ and $sgH$.
\end{defn}
%
%
Observe that with the above definition, a Schreier graph may have loops as well as multiple edges. Moreover, in $\Sch(G,H;S)$ every vertex has degree $\abs S$.

If $X$ is a set with a left action $G\curvearrowright X$ and $S$ is a symmetric generating set for $G$, the corresponding (left) \emph{orbital graph} $\Sch_{\mathcal O}(G,X;S)$ is the graph with vertex set $X$ and with an edge between $x$ and $y$ for every $s$ in $S$ such that $s.x=y$.
As the notation suggests, these two definitions are two faces of the same coin. Indeed, we have $\Sch(G,H;S)=\Sch_{\mathcal O}(G,G/H;S)$ for the  action by left multiplication of $G$ on $G/H$, while   for every $x\in X$, the graph $\Sch(G,\stab_G(x);S)$ is equal to the connected component of $x$ in $\Sch_{\mathcal O}(G,X;S)$.

Schreier graphs are generalizations of the well-known \emph{Cayley graphs}, with $\Cayley(G;S)=\Sch(G,\{1\};S)$, see Figures~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ} and~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ2} for some examples.

If $S$ and $T$ are two generating sets of $G$, the graphs $\Sch(G,H;S)$ and $\Sch(G,H;T)$ does not need to be isomorphic. However, if both $S$ and $T$ are finite, then $\Sch(G,H;S)$ and $\Sch(G,H;T)$ are quasi-isometric, see~\cite[IV.B.21.iii]{DelaHarpe2000} for a proof and Figure~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ} for an example. The only fact we will use about quasi-isometries is that they preserve ``large-scale properties'' of the graph, as for example the number of ends.
Observe that the requirement that both $S$ and $T$ are finite is crucial for the existence of a quasi-isometry between the corresponding Schreier graphs. Indeed, for every group  $\Cayley(G;G\setminus\{1\})=\Sch(G,\{1\};G\setminus\{1\})$ is always a complete graph on $\abs{G}$ vertices, in particular  $\Cayley(\Z;\{1\})$ and $\Cayley(\Z;\Z\setminus\{0\})$ are not quasi-isometric.

Let $\Gamma$ be a graph and $K$ a finite subset of vertices. The graph $\Gamma\setminus K$ is the subgraph of $\Gamma$ obtained by deleting all vertices in $K$ and all edges adjacent to them. This graph is not necessarily connected.
\begin{defn}\label{Def:Ends}
Let $\Gamma$ be a graph. The \emph{number of ends} of $\Gamma$ is the supremum, taken over all finite $K$, of the number of infinite connected components of $\Gamma\setminus K$.
\end{defn}
There exists other characterizations of the number of ends in graphs, 
see~\cite{MR1967888} and the references therein, but Definition~\ref{Def:Ends} is the one that best suits our purpose.
A locally finite graph (i.e. such that every vertex has finite degree) is finite if and only if it has $0$ end.

An important fact about the number of ends of a graph, is that it is an invariant of quasi-isometry, see~\cite{MR1213151}. In particular, if $G$ is a finitely generated group it is possible to speak about the number of ends of the Schreier graph $\Sch(G,H;S)$ without specifying a particular finite generating set $S$.
By a celebrated result of Hopf~\cite{MR10267}, the number of ends of a Cayley graph of a finitely generated group can only be $0$, $1$, $2$ or infinite (in which case it is uncountable), see Figures~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ} and~\ref{Figure:CayleyOfZ2} for some examples.
On the other hand, Schreier graphs may have any number of ends in $\mathbf N\cup\{\infty\}$, see Figure~\ref{Figure:SchreierOfF2} for an example of a graph with $4$ ends.
In fact, every regular graph of even degree is isomorphic to a Schreier graph,~\cite{MR0450121,MR1358635}.

We are now finally able to introduce property FW. Instead of giving the original definition in terms of actions on wall spaces, we will use an equivalent one for finitely generated groups, which essentially follows from~\cite{MR1347406}, see~\cite{Cornulier2013} for a direct proof.
%
%
\begin{defn}
A finitely generated group $G$ has \emph{property FW} if all its Schreier graphs have at most one end.
\end{defn}
%
%
It directly follows from the definition that all finite groups have property FW, but that $\Z$ does not have it.
In fact, if $G$ is a finitely generated group with an homomorphism onto $\Z$, then it does not have FW. Indeed, in this case $G\cong H\rtimes \Z$  for some $H$ and the Schreier graph $\Sch(G,H;S)$ is isomorphic to a Cayley graph of $\Z\cong G/H$ and hence has $2$ ends.

Property FW admits many distinct characterizations that allow to define it for groups that are non-necessarily finitely generated and even for topological groups. We refer the reader to~\cite{Cornulier2013} for a survey of these characterizations.

\subsection{Wreath products}
%
%
%
%
%
Let $X$ be a set and $G$ a group. We view
$\bigoplus_XG$ as the set of functions from $X$ to $G$ with finite support:
\[
	\bigoplus_XG=\setst{\varphi\colon X\to G}{\varphi(x)=1 \textnormal{ for all but finitely many }x}.
\]
This is naturally a group, where multiplication is taken componentwise.

If $H$ is a group acting on $X$, then it naturally acts on $\bigoplus_XG$
by $(h.\varphi)(x)=\varphi(h^{-1}.x)$.
This leads to the following standard definition.
\begin{defn}\label{Def:WreathProd}
Let $G$ and $H$ be groups and $X$ be a set on which $H$ acts.
The \emph{(retricted) wreath product} $G\wr_XH$ is the group $(\bigoplus_XG)\rtimes H$.
\end{defn}
A prominent  source of examples of wreath products is the ones of the form $G\wr_HH$, where $H$ acts on itself by left multiplication.
In particular, the group $(\Z/2\Z)\wr_\Z\Z$ has become well-known under the name of the \emph{lamplighter group}.
Other (trivial) examples of wreath products are direct products $G\times H$ which corresponds to wreath products over a singleton $G\wr_{\{*\}}H$.

Let $S$ be a generating set of $G$ and $T$ a generating set of $H$.
Let $\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a choice of a representative in each $H$-orbit.
Finally, let $\delta_x^s$ be the element of $\bigoplus_XG$ defined by $\delta_x^s(x)=s$ and $\delta_x^s(y)=1_G$ if $y\neq x$ and let $\mathbf 1$ be the constant function with value $1_G$.
It is then standard that
\[
	\setst{(\delta_{x_i}^s,1_H)}{s \in S,i\in I} \cup \setst{(\mathbf 1,t)}{t \in T}
\]
is a generating set for $G\wr_XH$.

On the other hand, if $\setst{(\varphi_i,h_i)}{i\in I}$ is a generating set of $G\wr_XH$, then $\setst{h_i}{i\in I}$ is a generating set of $H$ while $\setst{\varphi_i(x)}{i\in I,x\in X}$ is a generating set of $G$.
Observe that since the $\varphi_i$ take only finitely many values, if $I$ is finite, so is $\setst{\varphi_i(x)}{i\in I,x\in X}$.
We hence recover the following characterization of the finite generation of $G\wr_XH$.
%
%
\begin{lem}
The group $G\wr_XH$ is finitely generated if and only if both $G$ and $H$ are finitely generated and $H$ acts on $X$ with finitely many orbits.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
If $G\wr_XH$ is finitely generated, so is its abelianization $(G\wr_XH)^{\ab}\cong (\bigoplus_{X/H}G^{\ab})\times H^{\ab}$, which implies that the orbit set $X/H$ is finite. The other implications directly follow from the above discussion on generating sets.
\end{proof}
%
%
Using the above lemma, we could reformulate Theorem~\ref{Thm:Main} in the following way:
%
%
\begin{prop}
Let $G$, $H$ be two groups with $G$ non-trivial and $X$ a set on which $H$ acts. Suppose that all three of $G$, $H$ and $G\wr_XH$ are finitely generated. Then the wreath product $G\wr_XH$ has property FW if and only if $G$ and $H$ have property FW and $X$ is finite.
\end{prop}

\section{Proof of the main result}
\label{Section:Proof}
%
%
%
%
%
This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:Main}. This proof is split into two parts: Lemma \ref{Lemma:Semidirect_ends} and its Corollary \ref{Cor:Wreath_ends}, and Lemma \ref{Lem:Wreath_groups_ends}.

We begin by an easy result on quotients.
%
%
\begin{lem}\label{Lem:Quotien}
Let $G$ be a finitely generated group and $H$ a quotient of $G$. If $G$ has FW, then so does $H$.
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof}
First remark that if $G$ is generated by a finite symmetric set $S$, the group $H$ is generated by the projection of $S$ that we will also denote by $S$. 

If $H$ does not have property FW, there exists a subgroup $K$ of $H$ such that the Schreier graph $\Sch(H, K;S)$ has more than one end.
Let $L$ be the preimage of $K$ in $G$. As $G/L \cong H/K$, forgetting about loops and multiedges, the Schreier graphs $\Sch(G,L;S)$ and $\Sch(H,K;S)$ are isomorphic.
As adding loops or doubling edges do not change the number of ends, $\Sch(G,L;S)$ has more than one end and therefore $G$ does not have property FW.
\end{proof}
%
%
We also have the following lemma on semi-direct products:
%
%
\begin{lem}\label{Lemma:Semidirect_ends}
Let $N$ and $H$ be two finitely generated groups and $N\rtimes H$ a semi-direct product.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $N\rtimes H$ has property FW, then so does $H$,
\item If both $N$ and $H$ have property FW, then $N\rtimes H$ also has property FW.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
%
%
\begin{proof}
The first part is Lemma~\ref{Lem:Quotien}.

For the second part, let $S$, respectively $T$, denotes a finite generating set of $N$, respectively $H$.
Then the group $G\coloneqq N\rtimes H$ is finitely generated by $U=(S\times\{1\}) \cup(\{1\}\times T)$.

Suppose that both $N$ and $H$ have property FW. We want to show that every Schreier graphs of $G$ has at most one end. If they are all finite, then there is nothing to prove (and $G$ is finite). So let $\Gamma$ be an infinite Schreier graph of $G$ with respect to the generating set $U$. The groups $N$ and $H$ act on the vertices of $\Gamma$ by restriction of the action of $G$. That is, $n.x = (n,1).x$ and $h.x = (1,h).x$.
For each vertex $x$ we define $\Gamma_x^H$ (and respectively $\Gamma_x^N$) as the Schreier graph obtained from the action of $H$ (respectively $N$) on the $H$-orbit (respectively $N$-orbit) of $x$. These are subgraphs of $\Gamma$. As $N$ and $H$ have property FW, the graphs $\Gamma_x^H$ and $\Gamma_x^N$ are either finite or one-ended. We want to prove that in this case $\Gamma$ has exactly one end.

Let $K$ be a finite set of vertices of $\Gamma$.
If $x$ is in $K$ and $\Gamma_x^H$ is finite, add all vertices of $\Gamma_x^H$ to $K$.
By doing so for every $x$ in $K$, we obtain a new finite set $K\subset K'$ of vertices of $\Gamma$.
We will show that $\Gamma\setminus K'$ has only one infinite connected component.
By definition of $K'$, if $x$ is not in $K'$, then either $\Gamma_x^H$ has one end or $\Gamma_x^H$ does not contain vertices of $K'$.

Let $x$ and $y$ be two vertices, each of them lying in some infinite connected component of $\Gamma\setminus K'$.
We will construct a path from $x$ to $y$ in $\Gamma\setminus K'$ as a concatenation of three smaller paths, see Figure~\ref{Figure:PathSemiDirect}, as follows.
First, a path in $\Gamma_x^H\setminus K'$ from $x$ to some $z$, then a path in $\Gamma_z^N\setminus K'$ from $z$ to some $z'\in (\Gamma_z^N\cap \Gamma_y^H)\setminus K'$, and finally a path in $\Gamma_y^H\setminus K'$ from $z'$ to $y$.
In order to finish the proof, it remains to exhibit elements $z$ and $z'$ and the three desired paths.
%
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]\centering
\includegraphics{SemiDirect}
\caption{The path between $x$ and $y$.}
\label{Figure:PathSemiDirect}
\end{figure}
%
%

The action of $G$ on $\Gamma$ being transitive, there exists an element $(n_0,h_0)$ of $N \rtimes H$ such that $(n_0,h_0).x = y$.
Since $K'$ is finite, the set $\Gamma_x^H\setminus K'$ is infinite.
Moreover, there is infinitely many $z$ in $\Gamma_x^H\setminus K'$ such that either $\Gamma_z^N$ is one-ended or $\Gamma_z^N$ does not intersect $K'$.
For such a $z$ there exists $h$ such that $(1,h).x=z$.
Now, the vertex $z'\coloneqq(hh_0^{-1}.n_0,h).x$ is both equal to $(hh_0^{-1}.n_0,1)(1,h_0).x=(hh_0^{-1}.n_0,1).z$ and to $(1,hh_0^{-1})(n_0,h_0).x=(1,hh_0^{-1}).y$. That is, $z'$ is in $\Gamma_z^N\cap \Gamma_y^H$.
A simple computation shows us that the map $z\mapsto z'$ is injective: $z_1'=z_2'$ if and only if $z_1=z_2$.
Since $K'$ is finite, there are only finitely many $z'$ in $K'$ and hence there are infinitely many $z\in \Gamma_x^H$ such that both $z$ and $z'$ are not in $K'$ and either $\Gamma_z^N$ is one-ended or $\Gamma_z^N$ does not intersect $K'$.

In order to finish the proof, observe that the three graphs $\Gamma_x^H$, $\Gamma_y^H$ and $\Gamma_z^N$ are all either one-ended or do not intersect $K'$.
Therefore, there is a path in $\Gamma_x^H\setminus K'$ from $x$ to $z$ as desired, and similarly for the paths from $z$ to $z'$ and $z'$ to $y$.
We have just proved that for any finite $K$ the graph $\Gamma\setminus K$ has only one infinite connected component and therefore that $\Gamma$ is one-ended.
\end{proof}
%
%
As a direct corollary, we have
\begin{cor}
Let $G$ and $H$ be two finitely generated groups. Then $G\times H$ has property FW if and only if both $G$ and $H$ have property FW.
\end{cor}
%
%
By iterating Lemma \ref{Lemma:Semidirect_ends}, we obtain
%
%
\begin{cor}\label{Cor:Wreath_ends}
Let $G$ and $H$ be two finitely generated groups and $X$ a set on which $H$ acts with finitely many orbits. Then,
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $G\wr_X H$ has property FW, then so does $H$,
\item
If both $G$ and $H$ have property FW and $X$ is finite, then $G\wr_X H$ has property~FW.
\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}
%
%
The following Lemma finishes the proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:Main}.
%
%
\begin{lem}\label{Lem:Wreath_groups_ends}
Let $G$ and $H$ be two finitely generated groups with $G$ non-trivial and such that $H$ acts on some set $X$ with finitely many orbits.
If $G\wr_XH$ has property FW, then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ has property FW,
\item $X$ is finite.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
%
%
\begin{proof}
We will prove the contrapositives. The idea is to construct, for each of the two cases, a Schreier graph of $G\wr_XH$ with more than one end by exhibiting some well-chosen action of $G\wr_XH$.
We fix some finite generating sets $S$ and $T$ of $G$ and $H$ and let
\[

\]
be the standard generating set of $G\wr_XH$.
%
%
%
\paragraph{Suppose that $X$ is an infinite set.}
Since $H$ acts on $X$ with finitely many orbits, there exists an infinite orbit $X'$.
Let $x_0$ be an arbitrary vertex of $X'$.
The group $G$ acting on itself by left multiplications, we have the so-called \emph{imprimitive action} of the wreath-product $G\wr_XH$ on $Y\coloneqq G\times X'$:
\[
	(\varphi,h). (g,x) \coloneqq (\varphi(h.x)g, h.x).
\]
Since both $G\curvearrowright G$ and $H\curvearrowright X'$ are transitive, the action $G\wr_XH\curvearrowright Y$ is also transitive.
Therefore, the orbital Schreier graph of $G\wr_XH\curvearrowright Y$ is isomorphic to the Schreier graph $\Gamma\coloneqq\Sch\left(G\wr_XH, \stab((1_G,x_0)\right), U)$. We decompose this graph into leaves of the form $Y_g = \{ g \} \times X'$. There are two types of edges in $\Gamma$, which are coming from the two sets of generators, see Figure~\ref{Figure:Leaves}. The first ones, of the form $(\mathbf 1,t)$, give us on each leaf a copy of the orbital Schreier graph of $H \curvearrowright X'$. Indeed,
\[
	(\mathbf 1,t).(g,x) = (g, t.x).
\]
The second ones, of the form $(\delta_{x_0}^s,1)$, give us loops everywhere except on vertices of the form $(g,x_0)$. By direct computation, we see that the vertices $(g,x_0)$ and $(sg,x_0)$ connect the leaves $Y_g$ and $Y_{sg}$,
\[
	(\delta_{x_0}^s,1).(g,x) =
		\begin{cases}
		(g,x) & \textnormal{if }x \neq x_0, \\
		(sg, x) & \textnormal{if }x = x_0.
		\end{cases}
\]

\label{Figure:Leaves}
\end{figure}
%
%

If we remove a vertex $(g,x_0)$ we disconnect the leaf $Y_g$ from the rest of $\Gamma$. As $X'$ is infinite each leave is infinite and the number of ends of $\Gamma$ is then at least $\abs{G}\geq 2$. We just proved that if $X$ is infinite, the group $G\wr_XH$ does not have property FW.
%
%
%
\paragraph{Suppose now that $G$ does not have property FW.} Then there exists a subgroup $K$ of $G$ such that $\Sch(G,K,S)$ has more than one end.
Let $x_0$ be any point of $X$ and $X'$ be its orbit under the action of $H$.
We have the imprimitive action of $G\wr_XH$ on $G/K\times X$, which restricts to an action on $G/K\times X'$:
\[
	(\varphi,h).(gK,x) = (\varphi(h.x) gK, h.x).
\]
As above, the action is transitive and the orbital Schreier graph of this action is isomorphic to a Schreier graph $\Gamma$ of $G\wr_XH$. We decompose this graph into leaves in the same way. Now we look at the subgraph made up of vertices $(g,x_0)$ and edges $(\delta_{x_0}^s,1)$ and we remark that it is isomorphic to the Schreier graph $\Sch(G,K,S)$ which has more than one end. Then $\Gamma$ has also more than one end, which finishes the proof.
