@article{Kropholler1989,
abstract = {We introduce a new algebraic invariant ẽ(G,S) for pairs of groups S≤G. It is related to the geometric end invariant of Houghton and Scott, but is more easily accessible to calculation by cohomological methods. We develop various techniques for computing ẽ(G,S) when G and S enjoy certain duality properties. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

Geom. Topol. Monograph 1 (1998), 181-248). We observe that if a locally compact group G acts properly on a space with measured walls, then G has the Haagerup property. We conjecture that the converse holds and we prove this conjecture for the following classes of groups: discrete groups with the Haagerup property, closed subgroups of SO(n, 1), groups acting properly on real trees, SL 2 (K) where K is a global field and amenable groups.},

abstract = {For every simplicial complex X, we construct a locally CAT(0) cubical complex T{\_}X, a cellular isometric involution i on T{\_}X and a map t{\_}X from T{\_}X to X with the following properties: t{\_}Xi = t{\_}X; t{\_}X is a homology isomorphism; the induced map from the quotient of T{\_}X by the involution i to X is a homotopy equivalence; the induced map from the fixed point subspace for i in T{\_}X to X is a homology isomorphism. The construction is functorial in X. One corollary is an equivariant Kan-Thurston theorem: every connected proper G-CW-complex has the same equivariant homology as the classifying space for proper actions of some other group. From this we obtain an extension of Quillen's theorem on the spectrum of an equivariant cohomology ring and an extension of a result of Block concerning assembly conjectures. Another corollary of our main result is that there can be no algorithm to decide whether a CAT(0) cubical group is generated by torsion. In appendices we prove some foundational results concerning cubical complexes, including the infinite dimensional case. We characterize the cubical complexes for which the natural metric is complete; we establish Gromov's criterion for infinite-dimensional cubical complexes; we show that every CAT(0) cube complex is cubical; we deduce that the second cubical subdivision of any locally CAT(0) cube complex is cubical.},

We show that a group is multi-ended with respect to a subgroup if and only if it acts 'essentially' on a cubing. We explore several examples of this phenomenon. We discuss actions on finite-dimensional cubings, and show that in this case an essential action is simply an unbounded action. We discuss an application to the study of immersed incompressible surfaces in 3-manifolds.},
